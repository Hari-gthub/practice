MASKING POLICY 
-----------------
masking policy means to hide the sencitive data from database tables 
-> for example you develop a code and  you got some error ,you don't what exactly error is 
  you share you table information to other people in your team and you don't want to share your table sescitive data 
  that time you create masking policy and impliment that depensensitive data columns.
  access the data who has sysadmin,accountadmin priviliges then grant it.

  here syntax is

  create or replace masking policy database_name.schema_name.masking_policy_name
  as (val number) returns number ->
  case 
    when current_role()in('sysadmin','accountadmin') then val
    else 0
    end;

alter table database_name.schema_name.table_name modify column column_name
set masking policy masking_policy_name;
